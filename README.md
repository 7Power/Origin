# Origin

## Introduction
Origin is an emulator for the Shaiya MMORPG. It is written mostly in C#. The goal is to provide an open source, community involved emulator for Shaiya, and provide developers with an alternative that allows them to better develop content, and operate using a more stable server.

Origin is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged. If you wish to contribute ideas or code, please make a pull request to our [Github repository](https://github.com/isacsund/Origin/pulls).
